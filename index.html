                <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    In the harsh lands of 1899, the Nakota people stand as guardians of tradition, honor, and the old ways. We are warriors, hunters, and keepers of sacred wisdom passed down through generations.
                </p>
                <div class="divider"></div>
                <h3>Who We Are</h3>
                <p>
                    The Nakota Clan is a tight-knit community on the Royal 1899 Georgian server, dedicated to authentic roleplay and preserving Native American culture within Red Dead Redemption 2. We value respect, loyalty, and the bonds of brotherhood.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protect our lands and people from those who would do us harm</li>
                    <li>Preserve the traditions and wisdom of our ancestors</li>
                    <li>Stand together as one unified tribe against injustice</li>

                <h2>Clan Lore & History</h2>
                <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                <p>
                    Long before the white man's iron horses scarred the earth, the Nakota people roamed these lands freely. We are descendants of the great Sioux nations, bound by blood and tradition. Our ancestors hunted the buffalo, spoke with the spirits, and lived as one with the land.
                </p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <h3>The Changing Times</h3>
                <p>
                    As the year 1899 draws to a close, our people face threats unlike any before. The government seeks to confine us to reservations, settlers encroach upon our sacred grounds, and the old ways are under siege. But the Nakota do not break easily.
                </p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <h3>Our Territory</h3>
                <p>
                    We claim the northern territories as our homeland, where the mountains meet the plains and the rivers run clear. Here, we hunt, trade, and defend our way of life. Our camps are places of gathering, where stories are shared around the fire and the old songs still echo.
                </p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <h3>Sacred Beliefs</h3>
                <p>
                    The Nakota hold sacred the balance between earth and sky, man and beast. We seek guidance from the Great Spirit and honor our ancestors through ceremony and deed. The eagle feather represents courage, the wolf represents loyalty, and the bear represents strength. These symbols guide our path.
                </p>
